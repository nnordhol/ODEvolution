# ODEvolution

Simulate growth of bacterial populations in Python.

Refer to the jupyter notebook for a minimal working example on how to run serial dilution experiments with resource competition and periodic killing in silico.

This code accompanies our paper "Persistence against benzalkonium chloride promotes rapid evolution of tolerance during periodic disinfection" DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-27019-8
